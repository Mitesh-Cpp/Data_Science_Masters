# Data_Science_Masters

Welcome to my repository for the assignments and coding problems completed during my 8-month long Data Science Masters program. As a passionate and committed data scientist, I am excited to share my work with potential recruiters and showcase my skills and knowledge in the field.

Throughout the program, I have gained expertise in various data science concepts, such as statistical analysis, machine learning, data visualization, and data engineering. I have also developed proficiency in programming languages, such as Python (and its various libraries like numpy, pandas etc) as well as tools like SQL and Tableau.

In this repository, you will find a collection of assignments and coding problems that reflect my learning journey throughout the program. Each project has been carefully crafted to showcase my problem-solving skills, ability to work with complex datasets, and my capability to apply statistical and machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems.

I am confident that my experience in this program has prepared me to take on challenging data science projects and contribute to any organization's data-driven decision-making processes.
